Availability Estimate:
The recovery process should be really fast since we have configured our RDS as
multi AZ which means that we have a fast failover in case of single AZ failure,
and additionally we also created a read replica in another region (in case
of more than single AZ outage).

About the RPO, my assumption is that the app is running all the time.


Minimum RTO for a single AZ outage -> 1.5 hours (human factor, fixing the issue)
Minimum RTO for a single region outage -> 2 hours
Minimum RPO for a single AZ outage -> 1.5 hours
Minimum RPO for a single region outage -> 2 hours
