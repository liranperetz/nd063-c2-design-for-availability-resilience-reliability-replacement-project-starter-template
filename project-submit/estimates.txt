Availability Estimate:
The recovery process should be really fast since we have configured our RDS as
multi AZ which means that we have a fast failover in case of single AZ failure. 
Additionally we also created a read replica in another region for DR with daily backup.

Minimum RTO for a single AZ outage -> 1.5 hours (human factor, fixing the issue)
Minimum RPO for a single AZ outage -> 1.5 hours

Minimum RTO for a region outage -> 2 hours
Minimum RPO for a region outage -> 1 day
